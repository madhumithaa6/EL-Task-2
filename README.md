# EL-Task-2
# Titanic Data Analysis

This explores the Titanic dataset using Python.It involves generating summary statistics,visualizations,identifying patterns and trends,and making basic feature level inferences.

The dataset used is "Titanic-Dataset.csv", which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographic details and survival outcomes.
# Objectives
1. Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
2. Create histograms and boxplots for key numeric features
3. Use pair plots and correlation matrix to explore feature relationships
4. Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data
5. Make basic feature-level inferences based on visualizations
# Tools & Libraries
- "pandas" – Data manipulation  
- "numpy" – Numerical computations  
- "matplotlib" – Plotting graphs  
- "seaborn" – Statistical data visualization  
# Key Features Visualized
- Age
- Fare
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch(Number of parents/children aboard)
- Survived(Number of survivals from family)
# Summary of Observations
- Fare: Positively skewed, with a few high-value outliers.
- Age: Roughly normal distribution with some outliers.
- Survival: More females survived (inferred from gender-survival correlation).
- Family Size: Most passengers travelled alone or with 1 family member.
# Inferences
- Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival chances.
- Younger passengers tended to survive more.
- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- Solo travelers or small families were more common.
